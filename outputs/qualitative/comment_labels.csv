P6,Experimental System,The generation and text enhancement. I couldn't go back and forth with the brainstorming module so we could reach better ideas.

P9,Experimental System,"Brainstorming module was an amazing tool integrated in the website and I liked it the most. Prompting in a way that is understandable and sufficient for the LLM to get what I mean. I think the system works fine overall and the idea behind it is very cool. I can think of no major concern and downfall for the system, but as a bonus for the system, the UI could have been more aesthetic and compatible with different screen sizes. But except this, all other aspect of the site was okay to my eyes.","brainstorm_support, helpfulness_ai, usability_ui",neutral,0,0

P11,Experimental System,"every thing but mostly the latex generator solve a big problem for me. also, having every step of the question design in one place is a big feature for me. generally good but AI can make hallucinations some times. adding some more layers and RAG systems to prevent the hallucination.","design_refinement, helpfulness_ai, latex_pdf, time_saving",neutral,1,1

P8,Experimental System,"I love the brainstorming idea. I used LLMs a lot, but most of the times their generated ideas were somehow similar and somewhat not diverse ideas, however I mentioned in the prompts. It generated some diverse ideas, and I could chose one. Also, I liked the generation function, however, the design function did not properly expand and format the question for me, and I did not like it. - Coming up with the idea of the question
- Formatting and making the question easy to understand
- Checking the correspondence of the question to the topic
- Generating the PDF I would definitely improved the formatting functionality, as it could work better and provide better formattings, different types of formatting, expansion, shortening, stuff. Also, I would added customizations for the generating pdf functionlity.","brainstorm_support, design_refinement, formatting_effort, helpfulness_ai, latex_pdf, time_saving",positive,2,0
P8,Baseline,"It was well defined for me. While, since the references were not defined here (I forgot what was the references for AP course), it was challenging for me to find out whether I am off topic or not. - Coming up with the idea of the question
- Mechanisms to ensure the question is engough understanble, while challenging to avoid use of LLMs in a raw approach
- Find the most appropriate template for the assignment and rephrase it. I used ChatGPT for most of the task. I may integrated the LLMs into the process in a human-in-the-loop approach.","brainstorm_support, helpfulness_ai",neutral,0,0
